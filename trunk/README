The Calana Grid Workload Generator can create grid workloads for grid scheduler
evaluation. This software is GPL-licensed (see LICENSE file). You can obtain
the latest version from the project page at Berlios:

    http://developer.berlios.de/projects/cgwg/

The generator works as follows:
(1) Generate several cluster workloads using Lublin's model.
(2) Add runtime estimates.
(3) Mix these workloads together.
(4) Add users to the jobs in the mixed workload.
(5) Scale the workload to different workload levels.
(6) Generate a XML output file for each workload level

Since the workloads are stored as files, it is possible to reuse the same
workload several times, ensuring that different simulation runs of a grid
scheduler are comparable.

PREREQUISITES:
You need Ruby V1.8 installed. In addition, you need rubygems (a CPAN-like
repository for Ruby) and the gem "builder" installed. Please see

    http://docs.rubygems.org/read/book/1
    http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3

on how to install rubygems and the "builder" gem.

USAGE:
The configuration is directly build into the script workloadgen.rb, which
you may want to read.

Then, you may run

    ruby workloadgen.rb
    
to create a set of workload files in XML format.

TODO: (as of March 4, 2005)
* Need to switch to Dan Tsafrir's runtime estimate model (MD)
* Integrate coallocation jobs (MD)
* Incorporate workflows, which would replace the "preceedingJobID" values in
  the job description elements.
* Incorporate data transfers.
